# mobile_programming

This project is a starting boiler plate for a Flutter application. In this boiler plate we used the mobx and providers for the better state management. So the mobx uses Store classes which are compiled in the *.g.dart format.

Before running the application please run the below command if you don't see any *.g.dart format files.

[flutter packages pub run build_runner watch]

And if the *.g.dart format files are available then run this command.

<flutter packages pub run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs>
